Hi! I'm currently a Master's student in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) at **UC San Diego** and an aspiring PhD student.

My research interests primarily focus on **Document Understanding**, **Multimodal Document Processing**, and **Document Analysis utilizing Generative AI**. You can find more details in my [CV](/cv).

Previously, I worked as a **Senior Analyst** at **Deutsche Bank**, where I focused on **OCR** and **Document Understanding** to streamline document processing within the organization.

I graduated from [SPIT Mumbai](https://spit.ac.in) with a **B.Tech** degree in **Computer Engineering**. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a **research assistant**, conducting research on Cross Event Detection from social media data under the guidance of **Prof. Pramod Bide**. In addition to this, I have published three [research papers](/publications/) covering various topics, including NLP, Federated Learning, Explainable AI, Computer Vision, and Edge Computing. I was also honored with the **Best Graduation Project Award**

I enjoy learning about the fundamental workings of algorithms & systems, and attempting to build them from scratch. Additionally, I have a passion for solving real-world problems; feel free to check out my previous [projects](/projects).
